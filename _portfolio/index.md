# Portfolio

As a Data Analyst with over 3 years of experience, I excel in various databases such as MongoDB, SQL, and MySQL, effectively harnessing
data for valuable insights. I use cutting-edge data visualisation technologies like Tableau, Power BI, and Microsoft Visual Studio to break
down complex data to discover patterns and trends. My statistical skills include regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and clustering in
Python to identify trends and make data-driven decisions. My skill brings data to life, delivering impactful solutions for organizational
success.

The discussion here is generally non-technical; for the research projects,
related publications can be found in [my resume][1]. There are also links to
documents at the top of each page, which offer more depth. If you're curious
about technical details I've glossed over, feel free to [contact me][2].
